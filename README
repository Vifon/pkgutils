About the fork
==============

This is a fork of CRUX Linux pkgutils
<https://crux.nu/gitweb/?p=tools/pkgutils.git>.

I created this fork to allow the local package installation (e.g. in a
user's home subdirectory like $HOME/local, which is the default now)
and the operation as a non-root user (though using fakeroot for extra
cleanliness won't hurt).  The documentation was not updated yet and
there may exist some unhandled corner cases.

Installation
------------

Currently it should suffice to run "./install.sh"
or "env PREFIX=$HOME/something ./install.sh" which more
or less does the things specified below:

1. Run "make PREFIX=$HOME/local install" to install pkgutils without
packaging it (as we don't have pkgutils installed yet to package it
with).
2. Run "./pre-install" to initilize the package database.
3. Add the upstream repository to your Git clone as we need the tags from it:
       git remote add upstream git://crux.nu/tools/pkgutils.git
   ...and then fetch from it:
       git fetch upstream
4. Run "fakeroot pkgmk -d && pkgadd -f pkgutils#SOME_VERSION.pkg.tar.gz"
to install pkgutils as a package, overwriting the version installed
manually in step 1.

Note regarding point 2: Yes, it is confusing whether it is a pre- or
post-install script.  I consider it pre-install because the initial
installation wasn't done with pkgutils.

Updating pkgutils consists on just running "fakeroot pkgmk -d -u", there
is no need to perform the steps above more than once.

Note that the -d option of the pkgutils package works in an unusual
way as it doesn't download the archive but creates it on the fly.
This causes the need to update/ignore the MD5 sums quite frequently
after any introduced changes.  Expect to run "pkgmk -um" often for
this package and don't freak out, it is the expected behavior.
