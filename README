About the fork
==============

This is a fork of CRUX Linux pkgutils
<https://crux.nu/gitweb/?p=tools/pkgutils.git>.

I created this fork to allow the local package installation (e.g. in a
user's home subdirectory like $HOME/local, which is the default now)
and the operation as a non-root user (though using fakeroot for extra
cleanliness won't hurt).  The documentation was not updated yet and
there may exist some unhandled corner cases.  Notably, the package
signing doesn't work but MD5 which works should be sufficient for
basic usage.

Installation
------------

1. Run "make PREFIX=$HOME/local install" to install pkgutils without
packaging it (as we don't have pkgutils installed yet to package it
with).
2. Run "./pre-install" to initilize the package database.
3. Run "fakeroot pkgmk -f" to install pkgutils as a package,
overwriting the version installed manually in step 1.

Note regarding point 2: Yes, it is confusing whether it is a pre- or
post-install script.  I consider it pre-install because the initial
installation wasn't done with pkgutils.

Updating pkgutils consists on just running "fakeroot pkgmk -u", there
is no need to perform the steps above more than once.
